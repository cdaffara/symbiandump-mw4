defines a GOOM policy where Graphics RAM is released. The order below is the order in which the OOM Monitor releases RAM. 
Work on the GOOM Moitor config file will be based on this.

Aim of GOOM:
Run ALF plugin
Call on Policy Server of MM to free G Ram

<!-- 	Low RAM and good RAM thresholds are defined here in kilobytes.
	The max_app_close_batch indicates how many applications can be closed in parallel.
	The value 1 means that applications are not closed in parallel.
	default_wait_after_plugin defines how long is waited (in milliseconds) after
	an GOOM plugin is called and before the free RAM is checked to determine if more
	actions are needed. This value is meaningful only when "check" or "estimate" sync mode is
